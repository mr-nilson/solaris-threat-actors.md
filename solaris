Example
Edward Snowden: A former NSA contractor who leaked classified information, illustrating the potential impact of insider threats.
#Script Kiddies
Description
Script kiddies are inexperienced hackers who use pre-written scripts or tools to launch attacks, often without fully understanding how they work. Their motivations range from curiosity to a desire to prove their skills.

Risks to Solaris
Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities: Script kiddies often exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that have not yet been patched.
Website Defacements and Minor DoS Attacks: These actors might engage in website defacements or launch minor DoS attacks, causing disruptions and potential reputational damage.
Example
